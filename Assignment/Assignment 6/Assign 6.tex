This command will search for files in a directory hierarchy. If no starting-point is
specified, `.' is assumed.


\item  If you type find ., what will be the output?\\
Prints a list of files in the current working directory.
\\ It will search all the files and directory to
\item  How many types of files are available in Linux OS?
	Regular files\\
Directories\\
Character device files\\
Block device files\\
Local domain sockets\\
Named pipes (FIFOs)\\
